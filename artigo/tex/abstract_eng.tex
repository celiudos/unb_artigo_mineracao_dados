\begin{abstract}
	This study addresses the wage gap between men and women in the Information Technology (IT) field during the pandemic. It also explores possible scenarios to analyze the wage and turnover disparity between genders in the technology field, before and after the pandemic. Individual-level data from 2015 to 2021 were obtained from the Annual List of Social Information (Rais), which provides official data on the labor market in Brazil. Overall, it was found that, in addition to the number of female professionals being much smaller than that of men, the same behavior occurs for average wages. Under these two aspects, we see the data in terms of educational level, private and public sector, dismissals, and among IT positions. In all scenarios, the differences are much greater in 2021, when the pandemic was in effect.
