	This study aims to analyze the salary difference and the difference in the number of layoffs between men and women in the Information Technology (IT) area in Brazil from 2015 to 2021. For this, a bibliographic research on the subject was carried out, as well as an analysis of data from the Annual Social Information Report (RAIS) of the Ministry of Economy. The results showed that the number of women in the IT area is at most 30\% of the number of men. In addition, it was found that in all years of study there is a salary difference against women and regardless of educational level, IT position and sector where they work, whether public or private. Regarding the number of layoffs, it was not possible to perceive a significant difference between genders, except in 2021, when the percentage of men’s layoffs was 35.82\% and women’s was 29.91\%
